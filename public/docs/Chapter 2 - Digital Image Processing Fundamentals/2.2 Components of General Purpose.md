## Key Processes in Digital Image Processing

### Image Acquisition
- **Description**: The initial step where the image is captured using sensors.
- **Visual Element**:
  - An image of a camera or image sensor.
  - An example of an image being acquired (e.g., a photo of a scene).



### Image Enhancement
- **Description**: Techniques applied to improve the visibility of features in an image.
- **Visual Element**:
  - Before and after images showing enhanced details (e.g., a low-contrast image next to a high-contrast version).
  - Graphical representation of enhancement techniques (e.g., histogram equalization).


### Image Restoration
- **Description**: Process of recovering an image that has been degraded.
- **Visual Element**:
  - A side-by-side comparison of a degraded image and its restored version.
  - A flowchart showing the mathematical models used for restoration.

### Additional Processes
- **Color Image Processing**
   - Important due to the rise in digital image use.
- **Wavelets**
   - Foundation for representing images at various resolutions.
- **Compression**
   - Techniques for reducing storage and transmission bandwidth.
- **Segmentation**
   - Partitioning an image into its constituent parts.

### Elements of Digital Image Processing Systems
- **Storage** (Short term, on-line, archival)
- **Processing** (Algorithmic procedures in software)
- **Display** (Enables end-users to see results)
- **Communication** (Local and remote communication challenges)
---
### Image Acquisition
- Involves illumination sources and energy reflection/absorption.
- **Image Acquisition Using a Single Sensor**
   - Sensors transform incoming energy into voltage outputs.
